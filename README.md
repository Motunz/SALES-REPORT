# FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATION

. In order to increase the sales made in the other sales method, especially 'Online' sales method. Sales Promotion through advertisement should be done and this might include giveaways, free coupons, sales and so on to attract more customers online which will in turn increase sales. 

. More awareness should be done in countries like Virginia with low sales.

. Retailers recording low sales might be due to
1. Market Location
2. Product Price
3. Competitors

A thorough evaluation of the market location, target audience(demography, sex, purchasing power, income etc) and competitor should be carried out.
